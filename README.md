## Books
- [Remote : Office Not Required](http://37signals.com/remote/). A great book for every newbie at remote working. As its description, _As an employer, restricting your hiring to a small geographic region means youâ€™re not getting the best people you can. As an employee, restricting your job search to companies within a reasonable commute means youâ€™re not working for the best company you can. REMOTE, the new book by 37signals, shows both employers and employees how they can work together, remotely, from any desk, in any space, in any place, anytime, anywhere._
- [Remote Mob Programming](https://leanpub.com/remotemobprogramming). Remote Mob Programming combines two ways of working: Mob Programming and working as a distributed team.
